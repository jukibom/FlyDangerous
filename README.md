## A love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community ❤

Yes, racing exists in Elite and yes it's awesome -- but accessible it is not. 

This project aims to provide a ground-up reimplementation of a similar-enough flight model to provide a training ground and common set of tools to track leaderboards, ghosts and general tom-foolery. Feedback is extremely welcome!

## Planned Features

[Roadmap](https://github.com/users/jukibom/projects/1/views/5)

Major features: 

* Flight sticks of all shapes and sizes (done!)
* Basic time trial map types
  * Sprint: 1 start, checkpoints, 1 end (done!)
  * Laps 1 start block, checkpoints, lap counter
* Leaderboards with automatic replay / ghost upload via Steam (done!)
* Basic Multiplayer (done!)
* VR Support (done!)
* Infinite terrain generation (done!)
  * Freeplay flight, seed generation (done!)
  * Record + share racetracks (format supports it)

## Integrations

The game supports various peripherals, accessible from the Integrations tab in the Options panel.

### VR

The game uses [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) for headset VR integration. It can be toggled mid-game from the option panel or launched with the parameter `-vr` to start in VR mode.

VR is currently headset-only, gamepad / joystick / mouse + kb input and menu navigation is required.

**Unfortunately, Unity only supports OpenXR on Windows (I know, right?!) so for Linux it is advised to use Proton.**

### OpenTrack

[OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) is a head tracking application which interfaces with various hardware and webcams to provide head-tracking on flat screen displays.
Enable it with the option toggle and set OpenTrack to UDP output on 127.0.0.1, port 4242. 

For webcams, the neuralnet tracker input module is excellent. It is advised you bind a shortcut to recenter in the OpenTrack application.

### TrackIR

[TrackIR](https://www.trackir.com/) is a proprietary hardware head tracking solution. Fly Dangerous supports direct integration, simply enable the checkbox and go.
Be sure to have TrackIR installed and running when launching before launching into a map as the SDK is initialised when the player is created.

### bHaptics

[bHaptics](https://www.bhaptics.com/) is a suite of haptic feedback hardware. Fly Dangerous supports the TactSuit (x16 / x40) body vest, Tactocity for Arms and Tactal head feedback modules. Enable with the checkbox and suit should power up in-game.

### SimTools

[SimTools](https://simtools.us/) is a universal motion simulation software suite with integration for various peripherals, motion rigs and related devices. Enable the checkbox here to integrate with SimTools.

By default it uses 127.0.0.1 and port 33001 (SimTools defaults) but may be modified in the config file (`simRacingStudioOutputAddress` and `simRacingStudioOutputPort`).

### UDP Telemetry

The game supports raw telemetry output in the form of a binary byte or json firehose for arbitrary custom integrations. This is an advanced feature, see [this ticket for more information](https://github.com/jukibom/FlyDangerous/issues/115).

## Building

Unity build: 2022.1.20f1

The release build is reliant on some paid assets (follow instructions underneath to build without for dev purposes!):

* Map Magic 2 Bundle 2.1.9 - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/mapmagic-2-bundle-178682 
* AllSky 5.1.0 - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-200-sky-skybox-set-10109
* SC Post Effects 2.1.9 - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/sc-post-effects-pack-108753
* GPU Instancer 1.7.2 - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/gpu-instancer-117566

**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THESE ASSETS** (and, why would you?) and do not wish to buy them, follow these instructions to build:

* Ensure you have https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/mapmagic-2-165180 in your Unity account and download it with the in-build package manager under the "My Assets" tab (the free version of map magic will suffice, although you will miss some features and may not be able to load some terrains).
 
* Clone the repository

* Find the forward renderer asset in `Assets/Settings` and remove the missing renderer feature in the inspector. This is the SC Post fog effect.

* Go to Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Scripting Define Symbols. Add a new define, call it `NO_PAID_ASSETS`. This will disable any code references to non-free assets.

### Steam Integration

If you wish to build without Steam integration, add the Define Symbol `DISABLESTEAMWORKS`. This will completely disable all steam integration and UI functionality, and the multiplayer component will work with regular IPs + port forwarding.

### Running in the Unity Editor

The easiest way to get going is simply to load the Main Menu scene (`Assets/Scenes/UI/Main Menu`) but if you want to be able to jump right in when testing stuff, load `@Test Scene` from the root scenes folder and additively load a map and environment from their respective folders (set the environment as active scene for correct lighting etc). A ship player will be spawned at the location of the entity inside the `@Test Scene` root entity.
