## A love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community ❤

Yes, racing exists in Elite and yes it's awesome -- but accessible it is not. 

This project aims to provide a ground-up reimplementation of the a similar-enough flight model to provide a training ground and common set of tools to track leaderboards, ghosts and general tom-foolery. Feedback is extremely welcome!
