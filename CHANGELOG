[unreleased]
New:
    * Device hot-plugging now supported (#153)
    * Added a bit of spit and polish to the title screen
    * Player profile ship is now shown on title screen
    
Changed:
    * Interior Calidris cockpit glass reflectivity not quite so glaring anymore 
    * Advanced input mode renamed "Custom" because some people assumed there was no way to rebind controls
    * Updated to Unity 2022.1.8f1
    
Fixes:
    * Possible fix for VKBs always reporting "Hat Up" on rebind (thanks to the painful manual debugging efforts of Giskard for this fix!)
    * Was previously possible to unset protected bindings (which cannot then be rebound!)
    * Fixed (hopefully!) occasional rare crash on terrain load (#190)
    * Level panels load data in once per frame (Level UI element, ghosts, leaderboard entries) to eliminate stutter during menu transitions

0.5.7
New:
    * Added ability to bind lateral motion (horizontal, vertical and throttle) to the mouse axes (#188)
    * Added new map not for the feint of heart, good luck!

Fixes:
    * Ghosts disabled on first restart of a time trial map (#182)
    * Should now be impossible for UI elements to become unselected (#187)

0.5.6
New:
    * Added new extra-long time trial map
    * Added ability to entirely clear or reset input bindings to default (#161)
    * Restart button binding now works on Time Trial end screen (but not before syncing with leaderboard) (#165)
    * Added VR calibration dialog for first-time VR run (or users which have not calibrated before!) (#146)
    * Ability to set an FPS cap in graphics options (#170)

Changes:
    * Combined X and Y mouse modes into single mouse mode dropdown (default relative)
    * Set default mouse X axis to yaw for fps people (and Q/E are default roll anyway)
    * Free roam multiplayer join will warp to the host on spawn
    * Auto Roll for Arcade input has been separated out from Auto Rotation (#175)
        * Roll shoulder buttons have now been included in the control layout graphic in Arcade mode
    * Reworked the layout of the options panel a little to be more consistent and less confusing

Fixes:

    * Fixed axis deadzone possible to be > 1 in certain regions (#160)
    * Fixed dev panel applying insane torque on apply in certain regions (#163)

0.5.5
New:
    * Leaderboard now shows 50 entries - 25 above and below the player entry (or just 50 below if Sanderling)

Changes:
    * Pause menu and reset button now works during time trial countdown
    * Boost sound no longer requires round-trip to server in multiplayer
    * Music volume default lowered to 30%
    * Default leaderboard mode to show player rather than top 20

    * Fixed possible exploit relating to CPU throttling
    * Fixed broken scrollbars on leaderboard / ghost panels

0.5.4
New:
    * Drift hold key binding which does a few things for pilots using various forms of Flight Assist. (FA-OFF this binding does nothing!)
        * Disengages both vector and rotational flight assists
        * With auto-roll enabled, disables vector thrust
        * With auto-roll enabled, disables auto-roll (both in terms of input and correction-to-plane)
    * Added mouse to Time Trial results screen
    * Added toggle vs hold setting for each flight assist binding (default toggle)
    * Added current graphics API to version number to aid in debugging
    * Preliminary support for half-speed training mode (Thank you, Lueces!), currently hidden
    * Added support for gamepad to the profile / colour selection screen
    
Changes:
    * On map end, player and replay ships now come to a stop via flight assist rather than either bounce around erratically or just stop at the checkpoint
    * Smoke trails generating multiple particles at the exact same position (per-frame random vs per-particle random), this makes smoke look a lot more natural
    * Added notice on multiplayer selection making it clear it's a technical preview 
    
Fixes:
    * Swap default roll bindings from arrows to Q and E - arrows are camera!
    * Fixed displaying lights in replays
    * Properly shut down Steam API on application close
    * Incorrect start position on some Time Trial maps due to attempts to correct for proximity to terrain floor
    * ERRANT APOSTROPHE
    * Options / Profile Menu tooltips could get into an invisible state

0.5.3
New:
    * Added roll to shoulders / arrow keys when in Arcade mode (not specified in controls diagram, probably not needed!)
    * Switched to a system of including the distance to the checkpoint in the split timer calculation - this means all time trial timers are now far more accurate than 0.02 second splits
    
Changes:
    * Smoke trails now clear on map restart
    * Drastically increased visibility of trails at speed - stationary ships now produce LESS smoke
    * Added non-vr camera tweaks:
        * Camera now has greater flexibility to pull away during a boost effect - this is more prominent with external cameras
        * External cameras shake during boost
    * Ship shake effect now occurs while charging a boost (thanks, sanderling!) and is slightly more pronounced during the boost

Fixes:
    * Collision checks on checkpoints use a new system which hopefully dramatically reduces the chances of missing a checkpoint
        * New system should be marginally (very marginally) faster to set new times so a leaderboard reset isn't needed
    * Stretched flag on profile screen on ultra wide resolutions

0.5.2
New:
    * Added more appropriate easy vertical level 2 
    * Added experimental final map where the order of checkpoints is undefined
    * Added ability to specify audio speaker output (mono, stereo, dolby etc)
    * Added hint to enable numlock on bindings menu because unity input is crazy like that
    
Changes: 
    * Moved Snake to later in the list due to surprising difficulty of the tight corners
    
Fixes:
    * Fixed localised float string causing different level / leaderboard hash (forces invariant) 

0.5.1
Fixes:
    * Slowdown on multiple retries caused by uncleared debug log text buffer (backtick key shows in-game console)
    * Fixed multiplayer failing to connect due to unregistered prefab (no idea how this happened, honestly!)
    * Fixed possible soft-lock on results screen by clicking download and immediately selecting a ghost - the refresh replaced the element in a non-selected state

0.5.0
New:
    * Added in-game patch notes (oooo how meta, hello!)
    * Added Steam integration (Steam version features only, obviously ...)
        * No need to forward IPs on steam!
        * New server browser shows games in progress (steam version only) 
        * Steam Leaderboard integration for Time Trial!
    * Added ghost recording for Time Trial:
        * As many ghosts as you wish may be enabled
        * Personal Best is always recorded as a new ghost, and the fastest time is always enabled by default
        * Added sound mixer slider in options menu to reduce or disable sound of ghosts (default 25%) - this acts as a percentage of sound volume
        * On Steam version, ghosts are automatically uploaded and retrievable from Leaderboard
        * Ghosts can still be shared without steam, IF you can find the file. It must be placed in app data folder, 
          /StarGoat/FlyDangerous/Save/Records/[levelhash]/[filename].fdr, where `levelhash` is the same as the associated record time file. Uh, good luck?
    * Added ending screen for Time Trial with next level, retry and medal awards.
    * Added new ship camera rig
        * 5 camera positions + cycle binding: nose, bonnet, cockpit, external, external-far (default keyboard C or pad Y / triangle)
        * Added bindings for rotating the camera or looking around in first person (default numpad arrows)
        * Added ability to switch between absolute and relative camera rotation
        * Added camera controls toggle button (default unbound, default state ON)
        * Added mouse look toggle button (default keyboard M, default state OFF)
        * Added mouse look bind type (hold vs toggle)
    * Added new Arcade control scheme
        * Introduces and enables Auto Rotation by default - this applies pitch, roll and yaw based on orientation and lateral inputs
        * Uses an entirely separate binding set - this means you can freely switch between the two but Arcade cannot be customised (except for Y axis invert, as that's just always down to preference)
        * Added user on-boarding screen to include a brief explanation
    * Added Music
        * 5 Tracks + Main Menu
        * Music manager handles global music state:
            * Fade out on change
            * Maintain music on level change if next level is same music track
            * Ability to have intro + loop section
            * Low pass filter on pause
    * Added three new time trial maps
    * Added country flag dropdown to profile menu - this is shown in multiplayer, leaderboards and ghosts
    * Added third person cam FoV slider alongside first person FoV slider
    * Added new Checkpoint 3d model (much larger, circular)
    * Added Server Browser (Steam only)
    * Added Real-time reflections - quite expensive, low by default. Can be disabled entirely.
    * Added Soft Shadows - off by default
    * Added text explanations for EVERY. SINGLE. THING. in the options menu. Yes, this was tedious. You're welcome.
    * Greatly improved options panel non-mouse navigation - still work to be done here (especially tabs and bindings screen!) but much more usable in general.
    * Added UI Cancel navigation behaviour (navigate back one page) in main menu
    * Ability to set max angular velocity in dev options
    * Added new test GPU foliage terrain - performance feedback welcome please!
    * Added Free Cam system
        * This is NOT a finished feature and was built primarily to capture game footage for a trailer but it's here if you wanna play with it.
        * Bindings are no configurable - press F5 to toggle.
            * WASD / Gamepad left stick: Move
            * Arrows / Gamepad right stick / Mouse : Orientation
            * Space, Ctrl / Gamepad triggers: Height
            * R / Gamepad north face button: Lock orientation to face ship
            * Pause Break / Gamepad start: Freeze time
            * -/+ / Gamepad shoulders: increase or decrease movement speed
           
    
Changes:
    * Pre-calculate terrain on time trial load (all terrain near checkpoints is pre-loaded)
        * This should drastically reduce stuttering but with the trade-off that more is being rendered at any one time. Performance feedback welcome on this please!
    * Replaced basic light trails with GPU physics smoke particles based on thrust
    * Replaced space dust particle sprites with velocity-dependent line particles
    * Tweaked layout of lobby + time trial menus
    * Converted ray check to box check for checkpoint collision
    * Thruster luminance capped at minimum 50%
    * Rotational torque tweaks for a more responsive flight model - feedback welcome here!
        * Doubled rotational torque
        * Reduced rotational flight assist force (30% interpolation zone => 100% interpolation zone)
        * Rotational flight assist max rotation speed increased by 50% (3 rotations / sec)
    * Removed the "glass" renderer for UI elements - it was very expensive for very little gain, UI elements (e.g. mouse widget) are now always drawn on top
    * Update to Unity 2021.2 (bold or stupid? you decide)
    
Fixed:
    * All supported Gamepads + Joysticks can now be used in main menu UI navigation (still some work to do here, navigation in options menu is awful and may get stuck on textboxes etc)
    * Incorrect shadows on terrain worlds (light source below the generated terrain meant no shadows - fixed by making terrain two-sided for shadow generation)
    * Thruster lights emitters now respects user color selection
    * G force indicator now correctly calculates individual axes 
    * Updated Unity Input System, should resolve issues with certain HID joysticks (e.g. Virpil) with weird path descriptors
    * Boost sfx occasionally being mistimed / too fast
    * Axis dead zones failing to save
    * Axis dead zones not respecting defaults (0.05) unless overridden by user
    * Optimisations around component lookups in update loops (yes I was lazy and yes I paid the price, shut up)
    * Were you getting occasionally faster times for the first checkpoint? You probably weren't going mad: converted all game-critical timers to fixed-physics-frame tick counters.
    * Fixed mouse position being tied to HMD orientation in VR pause menu
    * Thruster UVs rendering incorrectly (rendering both sides)

0.4.1
Fixed:
    * Multiplayer failing to establish connection (null object check)
    * Multiplayer join menu could have empty textboxes (the placeholder text is fake)
    * Minor medal UI layout fix

0.4.0
New:
    * Added new ship, the Calidris!
    * Some much-needed Time Trial TLC
        * Added some new PLAYABLE MAPS and it only took six months
        * Added new Time Trial map selection + Level data system
        * Added target medal times to map data
        * Added saved / loaded personal bests
        * Added split time comparison to previous best
        * Added target (medal) times and personal best in-game
        * Added snapshot sfx to checkpoint 
    * Added ability to select ship and colors (in new Profile section from main menu)
    * Added additional cockpit indicators to calidris (g-force, assist status, limiter, lights, boost status)
    * Added independent thrusters with shader effect + spacial audio emitters
    * Lots of new sound effects in the cockpit and multiplayer-aware boost + thruster sounds
    * Added ship thruster trails (thank you very much to Tavi for spending time with me on that!)
    * Added new biome test world with 8k textures, let me know how this performs!
    * Ship lights and thrusters are shown on other ships in multiplayer (local player lights are prioritised in renderer)
    * Added basic support for gravity
    * New Throttle input options:
        * Ability to use the full throttle axis ("Forward Only" mode)
        * New binding to toggle reverse for forward only mode 
        * Ability to bind buttons to increase or decrease a virtual throttle (note: this is immediately reset if any continuous axis input is received)
    * New mouse input options:
        * New binding to recenter the mouse on demand
        * Mouse relative return rate - the higher this value, the faster the mouse will return to the centre
        * Mouse power curve - from 1 to 3, this raises input to the power of the slider to follow tighter curve
        * Added ability to force relative mouse on when rotational flight assist is disabled
    * Added audio volume preferences - master, music, sound effects and ui can be set independently
    * Cockpit camera FOV increase in non-VR mode under forward acceleration

Changes:
    * Updated to Unity 2021.1.17f1
    * Flight model changes to improve maneuverability while not boosting (thanks, Carda!)
        * Halved the default boost multiplier
        * Halved the torque multiplier
        * Doubled the base thrust force to compensate
    * Increased terrain world draw distance by 1 tile in all graphics scenarios (so anywhere from 33 to 100 percent increase)
    * Free roam now has ability to select location (removed experimental terrain flag)
    * Updated Cloudy terrain to have a more interesting skybox
    * Split boost sound between front and back and made boost action + sound multiplayer-aware (the doppler effect is *AWESOME*)
    * VR HMD position => input bind (default F11) now works in pause menu etc, should *always* restore position from preferences
    * Checkpoint collision checking now uses velocity-based raycasts and should work with any arbitrary speed
    * Cleaned up the bindings UI - now within one tab with related bindings grouped together
    * Minor change to options UI - small `+` button replaced with full header with animations - people were missing it and it's a lot more obvious now.
    * Tweaked exact positions of sun light sources

Fixes:
    * Fog no longer interacts with transparent objects (e.g. checkpoint)
    * VR view no longer brighter in right eye on terrain v1 (?!)
    * Cockpit camera position is now clamped for ridiculously fast builds
    * Options menu correctly re-initialises on show (previously maintained unsaved changes)
    * Space dust no longer fails to move origin with ship
    * Split timer fade out works correctly if two checkpoints are hit close together (would fade out super fast as an extra co-routine would start)
    * Fixed race condition with floating origin as it previously updated outside the physics update loop (oops!)
    * Mouse widget UI elements resets to center if mouse input is disabled (Thank you Lignar!)
    * [Linux] Mouse constrains to window correctly (Thank you Lignar!)
    * [Linux] Scroll speed + direction now consistent with windows build (Thank you Lignar!)
    * Converted mouse widget to proper unity sprites - should no longer have white fringes :| 

0.3.0
New:
    * Multiplayer - enormous refactor to a client => server architecture.
        * Lobby system - only host may make changes
            * Ready-up system
            * Chat box (lobby only for now)
        * Complete overhaul of loading logic.
        * Ability for non-host players to warp to the host (replaces Restart functionality).
        * Ability for host players to return all players to the lobby.
    * Targeting system - currently not user-selectable but draws a target and distance for elements in the world on the ship cockpit glass 
    * Menu system segregates single and multiplayer - oooo new icon buttons!

Changes:
    * Lighting pass on terrain worlds - terrain now renders shadows onto itself and other entities.
    * Shadow pass - shadows draw much further and have multiple levels of cascade. The cockpit effectively has an entire shadow map to itself.
    * Flight model changes:
        * Pulling back on the throttle at all now decreases forward thrust UNDER BOOST by up to 40% - previously this only worked on the bottom 40% of the axis and is now spread across the whole reverse axis.
        * Any residual thrust can now be pushed into lats + verts - this, by virtue of applying reverse throttle, applies automatically with vector flight assist when making tight maneuvers. 
    * Removed experimental HQ terrain - was worth a try but it ran poorly on many systems and caused multiplayer instabilities
    
Fixes:
    * Space station has had a much-needed collider pass, should now be able to fly between fine geometry details
    * Changing the default flight assist dropdown option will now apply that option immediately (no need to add key binds) 

0.2.2b
Fixes:
    * Apply rigidbody physics along with specialised ship param defaults on load. Sigh.

0.2.2
New:
    * Added VR toggle button in options (using param -vr still works but this is much simpler to toggle at runtime)
    * Added experimental high resolution terrain toggle - this MUST be used in conjunction with terrain LOD graphics option or you're going to have a bad time as it renders about 20 million triangles at max quality! Set to about 70-80% for a good balance. Looking for feedback.
    * Added less-noticeably repeating cliff edge texture
    * Added ability for people to build the github repo without paid assets
    
Changes:
    * Ship physics changes - scrapped shared thrust pool changes, thank you to everyone who gave feedback!
        * Increased mass to 1100Kg
        * Increased tensor multiplier to 175 to reduce spin on collision
        * Decreased torque by 25% (this is to balance a change to the ship mesh - size affects rotation!)
        * Decreased lateral thrust multipliers (lats by 28%, verts by 22%)
        * Decreased boost thrust and rotation effect time by 1 second each  
    * Ship model changes
        * Ship cockpit now 20% smaller - this feels WAY better in VR, flat screen should see very little change
        * Removed the front piece of the ship mesh, it made the ship look unnecessarily long and crooked
    * Lighting changes to noon clear (less orange tint, more vibrant summer colours)
    * Improved terrain and ship lighting on a per-environment basis (auto-regen baked lights of additive scenes on load)
    * Removed Fog Distance option - this is now auto-calculated based on the terrain type (chunk size) and chunk count.
    * Removed alpha message in favour of static text at bottom of main menu

Fixes: 
    * Remove redundant default FA toggle (replaced with drop-down!)

0.2.1
New:
    * Added dev flag for additive thrusters ("trichording") which effectively re-enables old behaviour WRT thrust sharing.
        * This allows each axis to operate with it's own max thrust amount and the flight params are now balanced for shared thrust. Feedback purposes only, Use at your own peril.

Changes: 
    * Swapped default flight assist for a drop-down of 4 possible options (all on, rotational only, vector only, all off). 
    
Fixes:
    * Fixed FA On boost drop-off being too harsh.
    * Fixed incorrect throttle assignment under boost (max forward should be 1, it was 1 + 1.6!).
        * This fixes the laterals being completely ineffective under boost.
    * Fixed incorrect rotation on VR HMD reset in certain ship orientations (quaternions are fun!)


0.2.0
New: 
    * VR Mode: Set the `-vr` flag parameter when launching the exe to use OpenXR. Do this either with steam or by making a shortcut to the exe.
        * Added HMD recenter binding - this is F11 by default.
        * NOTE: VR moe uses OpenXR - it is WINDOWS ONLY at the moment until Unity adds Linux support!
        * Custom cursor drawn in-scene on the UI canvases - this allows mouse operation in VR.
    * Graphics options!
        * Resolution [Applied instantly]
        * Screen mode (borderless / fullscreen / windowed) [Applied instantly]
        * Camera Field of View
        * Render scale 
        * MSAA
        * SSAO
        * Various terrain settings
    * Boost now has a recharge mechanic - holding the button will always boost when available, but repeated boosts are punished with drained capacitor.
        * Added values to dev options
    * Throttle no longer effectively max under boost - there is up to 40% draw back which can be achieved by pulling back.
    * Ship lateral thrusters no longer act on independent max thrusts - they share the same max thrust pool and therefore may be bled off.
        * Some ship agility re-balancing has occurred due to this change, see Changes below
    * Time Trial start timer with sound
        * Counts down from 2.5 seconds (beep on 2, 1, 0)
        * Boost is available 1 second before start, holding the button beforehand works
    * Added thrust + boost indicators
    * Added binding to use lateral vs rotational flight assists
        * Toggling both will defer to default preference (e.g. if usually on, will enable both if only one is active and disable if both active)
    
Changes:
    * Buffed ship agility 
        * Mass decreased by ~20%
        * Max available thrust increased by 10%
        * Boost thrust multiplier increased by 40%
        * Vertical thruster multiplier increased by ~12%
        * Horizontal thruster multiplier increased by ~30%
    * Removed placeholder display UI elements in cockpit and replaced them with ... absolutely nothing ^_^
    * Renamed input option "flight assist on by default" to "prefer flight assists on" (now multiple assists)
        
Fixes:
    * Timer no longer displays when restarting a free roam session
    * User preferences are now applied on startup by the Game class rather than User in-game
    * Track name is now serialised when copied to json
    * Fixed some binding options not displaying device name
    * Fixed SSAO shadow artefacts 
    * Possible fix for loading terrain on Linux (MM C++ Native loader is windows only :|)


0.1.5
Fixes:
    * Ship configuration default was not correct (boost time wrong by 1 second)
        * This should not affect times, but the end timer will be green if not changed ship params
    * Timer now correctly resets if terrain load is required
    * Ultrawide resolution fixes
        * Timer now displays clamped to top of screen
        * Options menu now fully scrolls to the bottom 

0.1.4
New:
	* Added multiple environment types and separated from map geometry (additive scene management).
	* Added ship spotlight + associated input binding for night maps (Default 'L' on keyboard).
	* Added experimental terrain (see Developer options in options menu!)
		* This terrain will take a while to load, here to gauge feedback.
	* Lighting pass - baked lights, per-environment volume lighting and dramatically improved in-cockpit shadows
	* Flight Assist rewrite - now functions like ED
	* Added placeholder sfx for flight assist toggle (reuses the alternate flight toggle)
	* Reduced rotational torque by 50% - it was uncontrollable under boost
	* Flight model changes
		* Added thruster multipliers to ship parameters
		* Mass reduced by 30% (results in gain of thrust and torque)
		* Overall torque reduced by 50%
		* Yaw torque increased by 60%
		* Horizontal lateral thrust reduced by 50%
		* Vertical lateral thrust reduced by 20%
		* Boost recharge time reduced by 1 second (20%)
    * Added mouse settings
    	* Sensitivity 
    	* Dead zone
        * Invert axis

Fixes: 
    * Shadow cascading now operates between two extremes - 0-1m and 1-2000m. This means an entire shadow map is dedicated to the cockpit and massively sharpens the texture while eliminating awful shadow flicker.
    * Updated to latest preview of the input system which now supports VJoy - you can now pipe any device through a VJoy driver and have it work in-game. It's not great but it's better than nothing if your device doesn't work :|

ALPHA 2 (v0.1.3)
-------

New:
    * Immediate restart: the game will endeavour to place the ship back at the starting location (either from custom level, race or regular free play) with as little loading time as possible. This I feel was especially important given the nature of the race tracks - short and difficult.
    * Changes to race mechanics: the ship now starts at the initial checkpoint and you can no longer re-run the race. This is to make sure races are entirely fair and cannot be gamed with timing the boost when entering the start point or waiting for moving features in the race track to pass.
    * Boost mechanic improvements: the velocity max speed no longer suddenly jumps from 932m/s to 800m/s, it gradually reduces (see the devlog video for more info on this)
    * Physics adjustments - ship less likely to get into an insane uncontrollable spin when clipping terrain
    * Level loader split from free roam, now respects locations (e.g. Space station custom maps)
    * Additional ship physics and mechanics parameters exposed in dev panel
    * Added an in-game console (use the ` key) to quickly debug input issues in release builds

Bug fixes:
    * Huge amount of input changes, should support far more devices. Let me know how you get on, virpil sticks still don't work, sorry! I'm trying :(
    * Fixed errant inputs on load (level starts with ship already in motion)
    * Fixed thrusters remaining on after alt flight control toggle (this still needs more work but it's uhm... broken in a slightly better way? Sorry, Nova!)

ALPHA 1 (v0.1.1)
-------
{ Initial release }
